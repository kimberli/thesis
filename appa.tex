\begin{enumerate}
    \item Extract the arc parameters: start coordinates, end coordinates, ellipse major and minor radii, rotation angle from $x$ and $y$ axes, large arc flag, and sweep flag. 
    \item Transform ellipse into unit circle by rotating, scaling, and translating, and save those transformation factors.
    \item Find the arc angle from the transformed start point to end point on the unit circle.
    \item If needed, split the arc into segments, each covering an angle less than $90^\circ$.
    \item Approximate each segment angle's arc on a unit circle such that the distance from the circle center to the arc along the angle bisector of the arc is equal to the radius, defining cubic B\'ezier control points.
	\item Invert the transformation above to convert arcs along the unit circle back to the elliptical arc, transforming the generated control points accordingly.
	\item Use these transformed control points to parameterize the output cubic B\'ezier curve.
