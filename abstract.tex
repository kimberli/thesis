In this work, we explore the applications of generative modeling to the design of vector graphics and establish a data-driven approach for creating preliminary vector drawings upon which designers can iterate.
We present an end-to-end pipeline for a supervised training system on Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) that learns to reconstruct training data and generate novel, unseen examples and demonstrate its results on font glyphs.
Our approach uses a variational autoencoder to learn sequences of SVG drawing commands and generates both input-based and unconditioned editable SVG outputs.
To investigate improvements to model performance, we perform two experiments: one on the effects of various SVG feature encodings on generated outputs, and one on a classifying model architecture for multi-class datasets.
